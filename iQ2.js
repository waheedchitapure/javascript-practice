Q2: Name some basic design elements
Entry 
Top 78 UX Design Interview Questions  UX Design  78  
Answer
The elements of design are:

LINE – The linear marks made with a pen or brush or the edge created when two shapes meet.
SHAPE – A shape is a self contained defined area of geometric (squares and circles), or organic (free formed shapes or natural shapes). A positive shape automatically creates a negative shape.
DIRECTION – All lines have direction – Horizontal, Vertical or Oblique. Horizontal suggests calmness, stability and tranquillity. Vertical gives a feeling of balance, formality and alertness. Oblique suggests movement and action
SIZE – Size is simply the relationship of the area occupied by one shape to that of another.
TEXTURE – Texture is the surface quality of a shape – rough, smooth, soft hard glossy etc.
COLOUR – Colour is light reflected off objects. Color has three main characteristics: hue or its name (red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).

Entry 
Top 85 Software Architecture Interview Questions  Software Architecture  85  
Answer
Load balancing is simple technique for distributing workloads across multiple machines or clusters. The most common and simple load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. In this type of load balancing the request is divided in circular order ensuring all machines get equal number of requests and no single machine is overloaded or underloaded.

The Purpose of load balancing is to

Optimize resource usage (avoid overload and under-load of any machines)
Achieve Maximum Throughput
Minimize response time
Most common load balancing techniques in web based applications are

Round robin
Session affinity or sticky session
IP Address affinity

Q5: What is SQL injection?
Entry 
Top 58 Web Security Interview Questions  Web Security  58  
Answer
Injection attacks stem from a lack of strict separation between program instructions (i.e., code) and user-provided (or external) input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a data snippet.

SQL injection is one of the most common types of injection attack. To carry it out, an attacker provides malicious SQL statements through the application.

How to prevent:

Prepared statements with parameterized queries
Stored procedures
Input validation - blacklist validation and whitelist validation
Principle of least privilege - Application accounts shouldn’t assign DBA or admin type access onto the database server. This ensures that if an application is compromised, an attacker won’t have the rights to the database through the compromised application.

Q6: What is Scope in JavaScript?
Entry 
Top 179 JavaScript Interview Questions  JavaScript  179  
Answer
In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that function can access that function's scoped variables.

A variable name has to be unique within the same scope. A scope can be nested inside another scope. If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.

Q12: What is Content Security Policy?
Junior 
Top 58 Web Security Interview Questions  Web Security  58  
Answer
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows site operators fine-grained control over where resources on their site can be loaded from. The use of this header is the best method to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Due to the difficulty in retrofitting CSP into existing websites, CSP is mandatory for all new websites and is strongly recommended for all existing high-risk sites.

The primary benefit of CSP comes from disabling the use of unsafe inline JavaScript. Inline JavaScript – either reflected or stored – means that improperly escaped user-inputs can generate code that is interpreted by the web browser as JavaScript. By using CSP to disable inline JavaScript, you can effectively eliminate almost all XSS attacks against your site.

Q13: What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Junior 
Top 58 Web Security Interview Questions  Web Security  58  
Answer
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

The page provided by the server when someone requests it is unaltered. Instead, an XSS attack exploits a weakness in a page that include a variable submitted in a request to show up in raw form in the response. The page is only reflecting back what was submitted in that request.

Q15: What is Callback Hell and what is the main cause of it?
Junior 
Top 126 Node.js Interview Questions  Node.js  126  
Answer
Asynchronous JavaScript, or JavaScript that uses callbacks, is hard to get right intuitively. A lot of code ends up looking like this:

fs.readdir(source, function (err, files) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error finding files: ' + err)
  } else {
    files.forEach(function (filename, fileIndex) {
      console.log(filename)
      gm(source + filename).size(function (err, values) {
        if (err) {
          console.log('Error identifying file size: ' + err)
        } else {
          console.log(filename + ' : ' + values)
          aspect = (values.width / values.height)
          widths.forEach(function (width, widthIndex) {
            height = Math.round(width / aspect)
            console.log('resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height)
            this.resize(width, height).write(dest + 'w' + width + '_' + filename, function(err) {
              if (err) console.log('Error writing file: ' + err)
            })
          }.bind(this))
        }
      })
    })
  }
})
See the pyramid shape and all the }) at the end? This is affectionately known as callback hell.

The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. Lots of people make this mistake! In other languages like C, Ruby or Python there is the expectation that whatever happens on line 1 will finish before the code on line 2 starts running and so on down the file.

Q24: How does concurrency work in Node.js?
Mid 
Top 126 Node.js Interview Questions  Node.js  126  
Answer
The thing with node.js is that everything runs concurrently, except for your code.

So, what that means is that there are actually lots of threads running inside Node.js virtual machine (or a thread pool if you wish), and those threads are utilized whenever you call an async function like performing i/o operations on files, accessing databases, requesting urls, etc.

However, for your code, there is only a single thread, and it processes events from an event queue. So, when you register a callback its reference is actually passed to the background worker thread, and once the async operation is done, new event is added to the event-queue with that callback

When Node gets I/O request it creates or uses a thread to perform that I/O operation and once the operation is done, it pushes the result to the event queue. On each such event, event loop runs and checks the queue and if the execution stack of Node is empty then it adds the queue result to execution stack.

This is how Node manages concurrency.

Q25: Mention what is the difference between PUT and POST?
Mid 
Top 46 API Design Interview Questions  API Design  46  
Answer
PUT puts a file or resource at a particular URI and exactly at that URI. If there is already a file or resource at that URI, PUT changes that file or resource. If there is no resource or file there, PUT makes one

POST sends data to a particular URI and expects the resource at that URI to deal with the request. The web server at this point can decide what to do with the data in the context of specified resource

PUT is idempotent meaning, invoking it any number of times will not have an impact on resources.

However, POST is not idempotent, meaning if you invoke POST multiple times it keeps creating more resources

Q26: Name fundamental principles of design
Mid 
Top 78 UX Design Interview Questions  UX Design  78  
Answer
The fundamental principles of design are:

BALANCE — Balance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. Balance provides stability and structure to a design. It’s the weight distributed in the design by the placement of your elements.
PROXIMITY — Proximity creates a relationship between elements. It provides a focal point. Proximity doesn’t mean that elements have to be placed together, it means they should be visually connected in some way.
ALIGNMENT — Allows us to create order and organization. Aligning elements allows them to create a visual connection with each other.
REPETITION — Repetition strengthens a design by tying together individual elements. It helps to create association and consistency. Repetition can create rhythm (a feeling of organized movement).
CONTRAST — Contrast is the juxtaposition of opposing elements (opposite colors on the color wheel, or value light/dark, or direction — horizontal/vertical). Contrast allows us to emphasize or highlight key elements in your design.
SPACE — Space in art refers to the distance or area between, around, above, below, or within elements. Both positive and negative space are important factors to be considered in every design.

Q27: What are defer and async attributes on a <script> tag?
Mid 
Top 55 HTML5 Interview Questions  HTML5  55  
Answer
If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed synchronously, and will halt parsing of the document until it has finished executing (default behavior). Scripts are downloaded and executed in the order they are encountered.

The defer attribute downloads the script while the document is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener. defer scripts will execute in order.

The async attribute downloads the script during parsing the document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has fully finished parsing. async scripts will not necessarily execute in order.

Note: both attributes must only be used if the script has a src attribute (i.e. not an inline script).

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
<script src="myscript.js" defer></script>

Q28: What does SOLID stand for? What are its principles?
Mid 
Top 85 Software Architecture Interview Questions  Software Architecture  85  
Answer
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin.

S - Single-responsiblity principle. A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
O - Open-closed principle. Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L - Liskov substitution principle. Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
I - Interface segregation principle. A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle. Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

ClickJacking is an attack that fools users into thinking they are clicking on one thing when they are actually clicking on another. The attack is possible thanks to HTML frames (iframes).

Its other name, user interface (UI) redressing, better describes what is going on. Users think they are using a web page’s normal UI, but in fact there is a hidden UI in control; in other words, the UI has been redressed. When users click something they think is safe, the hidden UI performs a different action.

a;				// "42"
b;				// 42 -- the number!
And here's an example of implicit coercion:

var a = "42";

var b = a * 1;	// "42" implicitly coerced to 42 here

a;				// "42"
b;				// 42 -- the number!

})();
// "Hello!"
This pattern is often used when trying to avoid polluting the global namespace, because all the variables used inside the IIFE (like in any other normal function) are not visible outside its scope.

HTML 5 adds a lot of new features to the HTML specification

New Doctype

Still using that pesky, impossible-to-memorize XHTML doctype?

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
If so, why? Switch to the new HTML5 doctype. You'll live longer -- as Douglas Quaid might say.

<!DOCTYPE html>
New Structure

<section> - to define sections of pages
<header> - defines the header of a page
<footer> - defines the footer of a page
<nav> - defines the navigation on a page
<article> - defines the article or primary content on a page
<aside> - defines extra content like a sidebar on a page
<figure> - defines images that annotate an article
New Inline Elements

These inline elements define some basic concepts and keep them semantically marked up, mostly to do with time:

<mark> - to indicate content that is marked in some fashion
<time> - to indicate content that is a time or date
<meter> - to indicate content that is a fraction of a known range - such as disk usage
<progress> - to indicate the progress of a task towards completion
New Form Types

<input type="datetime">
<input type="datetime-local">
<input type="date">
<input type="month">
<input type="week">
<input type="time">
<input type="number">
<input type="range">
<input type="email">
<input type="url">
New Elements

There are a few exciting new elements in HTML 5:

<canvas> - an element to give you a drawing space in JavaScript on your Web pages. It can let you add images or graphs to tool tips or just create dynamic graphs on your Web pages, built on the fly.
<video> - add video to your Web pages with this simple tag.
<audio> - add sound to your Web pages with this simple tag.
No More Types for Scripts and Links

You possibly still add the type attribute to your link and script tags.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script.js"></script>
This is no longer necessary. It's implied that both of these tags refer to stylesheets and scripts, respectively. As such, we can remove the type attribute all together.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/stylesheet.css" />
<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
Make your content editable

The new browsers have a nifty new attribute that can be applied to elements, called contenteditable. As the name implies, this allows the user to edit any of the text contained within the element, including its children. There are a variety of uses for something like this, including an app as simple as a to-do list, which also takes advantage of local storage.

<h2> To-Do List </h2>
<ul contenteditable="true">
  <li> Break mechanical cab driver. </li>
  <li> Drive to abandoned factory
  <li> Watch video of self </li>
</ul>
Attributes

autofocus puts the cursor on the input field

Q35: What’s the difference between resetting and normalizing CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
Mid 
Top 50 CSS Interview Questions  CSS  50  
Answer
Resetting — is meant to strip all default browser styling on elements. For e.g. margins, paddings, font-sizes of all elements are reset to be the same. You will have to redeclare styling for common typographic elements.
Normalizing — preserves useful default styles rather than “unstyling” everything. It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.
It's a good idea to choose resetting when you have very a customized or unconventional site design such that I need to do a lot of my own styling do not need any default styling to be preserved.

Q36: When would you use AngularJS vs jQuery?
Mid 
Top 51 jQuery Interview Questions  jQuery  51  
Answer
jQuery - is a library used for DOM Manipulations - Has nothing to do with models - don't have two-way binding feature - becomes complex and difficult to maintain when size of project increases - Sometimes you have to write more code to achieve the same functionality as in Angular

Angular - is a MVVM Framework - Used for creating SPA (Single Page Applications) - Has key features like routing, directives, two way data binding, models, dependency injection, unit tests etc - is modular - Maintainable, when project size increases - is Fast and many more.

Basically jQuery is a single tool (solves one specific problem: dom manipulation) where AngularJS is a whole toolbox with all kind of tools for different problems (routing, modelbindings, dom manipulation, etc.). Actually jqLite (subset of jQuery) is part of the AngularJS and you use it to solve the dom-manipulation thing.
